start point of algorithm  : GetValidPath function.

We pass the list of diverse paths, sorted by length, to this function.

This function checks each path in the following manner:

For each path: 754
    segment = get next segment in the path 774
    start = start of segment, initialize at 757
    goal = end of segment 783
    validate segment 791
    if segment is valid: 799
        start = goal 809
    else:
        calculate wait cost 822-824
        calcualte deflection cost 829-858
        diverse cost = length of next path 862-864

        Find social navigation strategy based on costs. 867
        result = is social navigation successful ? It is successful for the current path when we either wait or deflect otherwise false
        lines 875 and 887

        if (result) 915
            start = goal 917
        else
            break and check the next path in the list 919
