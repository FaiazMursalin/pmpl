The elbowtunnel problem is a narrow-passage environment with the following specifications:

- homogenous
- 400 cubic units of volume (40 x 10 x 1)
- 19% C-free, 81% C-obs

There are three robots included, with varying dimensions:

- cube1.g = 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 (easier problem)
	- each sample occupies 1/76000 of the total free space

- cube5.g = 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 (default)
	- each sample occupies 1/608 of the total free space

- cube8.g = 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 (more difficult problem)
	- each sample occupies approx. 1/148 of the total free space
